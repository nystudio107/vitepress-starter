## Requirements

n/a

## Overview

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then copy the contents (including the hidden `.gitignore` file) into the root directory of your plugin via:

```
git clone https://github.com/nystudio107/vitepress-starter.git
```

It's done this way as a "starter" rather than as a package, because you'll want to make bespoke changes to it.
